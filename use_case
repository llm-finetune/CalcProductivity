GitHub Copilot for Legacy Code Migration in Web Applications

Business Case:
Modernizing legacy applications is critical for enhancing maintainability, security, and scalability. Migrating VB6/ASP pages to ASP.NET (C#) reduces technical debt and aligns the technology stack, resulting in improved performance and reduced long-term costs.

Background:
The current web application is a hybrid solution developed using ASP.NET (C#) for newer components and classic VB6/ASP for legacy pages. Maintaining dual technology stacks has increased complexity, operational costs, and the risk of errors due to inconsistent practices.

Objective:
To fully migrate all legacy VB6/ASP pages to ASP.NET (C#) while ensuring functionality, performance, and maintainability are either preserved or enhanced. This initiative also aims to standardize the development environment and adopt modern DevOps practices.

Stakeholders:

Project Sponsors & Business Leaders

Development & QA Teams

IT Infrastructure Team

End Users & Product Owners

Challenges:

Difficulty in understanding and translating legacy VB6/ASP logic

Lack of comprehensive documentation

High risk of regression during migration

Resource constraints and skill gap in legacy technologies

Maintaining business continuity during the transition

Solution:
Use GitHub Copilot to assist developers by automatically generating C# equivalents of legacy VB6/ASP logic. Copilot can suggest context-aware code, improve productivity, and reduce the cognitive load on developers unfamiliar with legacy syntax.

Use Cases:

Code translation: Assist in converting VB6 procedures to C# methods

Pattern recognition: Identify reusable migration patterns

Documentation generation: Create inline comments and summaries

Refactoring support: Optimize migrated code for performance and clarity

Expected Outcomes:

Accelerated migration timeline

Reduced development and maintenance costs

Higher code quality through consistent standards

Improved developer efficiency and knowledge transfer

Unified technology stack across the application

Implementation Steps:

Inventory and assess VB6/ASP components

Use GitHub Copilot to create C# prototypes of legacy modules

Validate migrated code through automated and manual testing

Incrementally deploy and monitor migrated components

Train developers in best practices for Copilot-assisted migration

Conduct code reviews and performance optimization

Conclusion:
GitHub Copilot is a powerful enabler for legacy application modernization. It bridges the skill gap, reduces manual effort, and ensures that the migration to a unified ASP.NET stack is efficient and reliable. Leveraging AI-assisted development allows teams to focus on delivering value rather than grappling with outdated code.
