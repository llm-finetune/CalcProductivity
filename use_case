Modernization of Legacy Web Application with GitHub Copilot Assistance

Business Case:
The current application, developed using a mix of ASP.NET/C# and legacy ASP/VB6 technologies, is difficult to maintain and scale. With VB6 officially unsupported by Microsoft, there is an urgent need to transition to a modern tech stack—.NET Core and Angular—to ensure long-term viability, security, and developer efficiency.

Background:
VB6 was officially deprecated and is no longer supported, posing significant risks in terms of security vulnerabilities, integration challenges, and lack of developer expertise. The hybrid nature of the current codebase increases technical debt, impedes agility, and hinders the adoption of modern CI/CD practices.

Objective:
To migrate all legacy components (ASP/VB6 and ASP.NET Web Forms) to a modern, maintainable architecture using .NET Core for the backend and Angular for the frontend, while leveraging GitHub Copilot to accelerate development and improve code quality.

Stakeholders:

Executive Sponsors

Software Development & QA Teams

IT Operations & Infrastructure Teams

Product Owners & End Users

Challenges:

Migrating unsupported VB6 code with limited documentation

Ensuring feature parity during refactor and replatform

Skill gaps in modern frameworks (Angular, .NET Core)

Risk of introducing defects during the transformation

Time and resource constraints

Solution:
Use GitHub Copilot to assist developers by:

Translating legacy VB6/ASP logic to .NET Core C#

Assisting in frontend redevelopment using Angular

Generating unit and integration tests for critical modules

Enhancing developer productivity with real-time code suggestions

Use Cases:

Automatic generation of C# equivalents for VB6 business logic

Frontend scaffolding and reusable Angular components

Unit test creation for legacy and new modules using xUnit/NUnit

Documentation generation for improved maintainability

Expected Outcomes:

Modern, maintainable, and scalable application architecture

Faster migration with fewer defects

Unified development stack that enhances collaboration and deployment

Increased test coverage and application reliability

Reduced technical debt and future-proofed solution

Implementation Steps:

Audit existing VB6/ASP and ASP.NET components

Set up modern development pipelines (.NET Core, Angular)

Use GitHub Copilot to assist with backend and frontend code migration

Auto-generate and validate unit tests for all refactored modules

Conduct peer reviews and integrate with CI/CD pipelines

Gradually replace legacy components and perform UAT

Train teams on modern architecture and Copilot usage

Conclusion:
Migrating to .NET Core and Angular is essential for sustainability and innovation. GitHub Copilot significantly reduces the complexity and effort of this transformation, enabling developers to focus on business value while ensuring quality, consistency, and speed. Embracing AI-assisted development accelerates modernization and reduces risk in transitioning from unsupported technologies.
