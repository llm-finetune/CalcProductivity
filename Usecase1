Accelerating Automation of SWIFT Message Processing Enhancements with GitHub Copilot

Business Case:
The application processes real-time SWIFT messages using Java utilities running on Linux and interacting with IBM MQs via a third-party tool (GTXchange). With each release, repetitive enhancements—particularly BIC (Bank Identification Code) implementations—require updates across multiple configurations, unit tests, QA procedures, and regression suites. Automating these tasks will significantly reduce effort, errors, and turnaround time.

Background:
Every release involves manual and repetitive updates for new BIC implementations. These include modifying utility configurations, updating unit and regression test suites, and performing repeated QA validations. This slows down delivery cycles and burdens developers and QA teams with low-value, manual work.

Objective:
To streamline and automate repetitive tasks associated with BIC enhancements using custom-built utilities. GitHub Copilot will assist developers in rapidly developing these utilities, improving efficiency, reducing errors, and shortening release timelines.

Stakeholders:
	•	Development & QA Teams
	•	Release Management & DevOps Teams
	•	Product Managers
	•	Infrastructure/Operations Teams

Challenges:
	•	High volume of repetitive and manual tasks per release
	•	Inconsistent implementation of enhancements across utilities
	•	Time-consuming testing and regression suite updates
	•	Risk of human error in critical message-processing logic
	•	Limited bandwidth to build automation utilities from scratch

Solution:
Use GitHub Copilot to rapidly build utilities that automate repetitive tasks such as configuration updates, test generation, and regression suite maintenance. Copilot assists in generating well-structured, tested Java code with minimal manual effort.

Use Cases:
	•	Generate Java utilities to automate BIC configuration updates
	•	Automatically scaffold unit and integration tests for new BICs
	•	Create scripts to automate regression suite updates
	•	Use Copilot to document and standardize enhancements across utilities
	•	Accelerate creation of shell scripts or Ansible playbooks for Linux-based automation

Expected Outcomes:
	•	Significant reduction in manual effort for each release
	•	Accelerated development and deployment cycles
	•	Fewer errors and more consistent implementation of enhancements
	•	Improved test coverage and QA confidence
	•	Empowered development and QA teams through automation

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Identify and catalog all repetitive BIC-related enhancement tasks
	2.	Use GitHub Copilot to assist in building reusable Java utilities and test scaffolds
	3.	Develop and test automation scripts for configuration and regression updates
	4.	Integrate new utilities into the release pipeline
	5.	Train dev and QA teams to leverage Copilot for future enhancements
	6.	Measure efficiency gains and refine automation over time

Conclusion:
By introducing GitHub Copilot, development and QA teams can automate repetitive BIC enhancement tasks more effectively and reliably. Copilot accelerates utility creation, ensures consistency, and frees up valuable resources for strategic development. This results in faster releases, better quality, and a more agile SWIFT message processing system.
